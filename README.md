QCNN-based Syndrome Decoding for the 3-Qubit Repetition Code:
QCNN-based syndrome decoding for the 3-qubit repetition code. Noisy QEC data is generated in Qiskit to benchmark QCNN against a classical neural network for parity classification. Results show that the QCNN is more robust under noise and captures quantum correlations more effectively.
Project Summary:
This project explores syndrome decoding in the 3-qubit repetition code using both Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) and classical neural networks. A noisy quantum error correction dataset is generated by simulating encoding, bit-flip errors, and syndrome extraction in Qiskit. Both models classify the parity of the injected error from syndrome measurements under clean and noisy inputs.
Pipeline Overview:
The implementation consists of the following stages:
• Generate noisy QEC syndrome data from the 3-qubit bit-flip code
• Train a classical neural network as a baseline decoder
• Build a QCNN using parameterized quantum circuits
• Evaluate both models on clean and noisy data
• Compare robustness and accuracy
Model Descriptions:
Classical Neural Network
A feedforward MLP is trained on syndrome bits using binary classification.
QCNN Model
The QCNN uses Ry encoding for syndrome bits, entanglement via two-qubit unitaries, and a pooling structure to extract parity information from quantum inputs.
Results:
Both models perform well on clean data, but the QCNN is more robust under noise.
Classical NN (clean accuracy): 0.937
QCNN (clean accuracy): 0.937
Classical NN (noisy accuracy): 0.847
QCNN (noisy accuracy): 0.874
The QCNN shows a smaller accuracy drop, indicating stronger noise resilience and improved generalization.
Conclusion:
QCNNs demonstrate advantages in syndrome decoding tasks, especially under noisy conditions, and show potential as quantum-native decoders for QEC.
